# fmAutoMate-Services

fmAutoMate-Services add right-click functionality to your calculation editor, just like 


functions to the Services menu on macOS.

This makes working with calculations in the functions editor far easier.



By default, when you install fmAutoMate the fmAutoMate-Services are installed autoamtically.

Once you have installed fmAutoMate in your FileMaker

- In the Script Workspace right click to get the fmAutoMate context menu
- choose fmAutoMate > Services > Install fmAutoMate-Services menu to install the Services for your user.

To use

- Open a calculation editor in FileMaker and type or select some lines of code(*)
- Right Click the selected text and from the context menu choose one of the fmAutoMate-Services under `Services > fmAutoMate > ...`


(*) In fact you can select any text in any app, making it possible to use the fmAutoMate-Services in your favourite text editor, if you wish.
